    Args:

            inputs x. It is okay for it to produce batch outputs on batches of x as long
            as it produces a single number for single x. Has the signature

    Returns:
        Callable: function which computes the local kinetic energy for continuous
        problems (as opposed to discrete/lattice problems), i.e. -0.5 nabla^2 psi / psi.
        Evaluates on batches due to the jax.vmap call, so it has signature
