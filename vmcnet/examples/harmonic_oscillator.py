    """Create orbitals for a set of non-interacting quantum harmonic oscillators.

    The single-particle quantum harmonic oscillator for particle i has the Hamiltonian

        H = -(1/2) d^2/dx^2 + (1/2) (omega * x)^2,

    where the first term is the second derivative/1-D Laplacian and the second term is
    the harmonic oscillator potential. The corresponding energy eigenfunctions take the
    simple form

        psi_n(x) = C * exp(-omega * x^2 / 2) * H_n(sqrt(omega) * x),

    where C is a normalizing constant and H_n is the nth Hermite polynomial. The
    corresponding energy level is simply E_n = omega * (n + (1/2)).

    With N non-interacting particles, the total many-body Hamiltonian is simply
    H = sum_i H_i, and the above single-particle energy eigenfunctions become analogous
    to molecular orbitals. Due to the antisymmetry requirement on particle states, the
    N particles cannot occupy the same orbitals, so in the ground state configuration,
    the particles fill the lowest energy orbitals first. If some fixed spin
    configuration is specified, then the corresponding ground state configuration is the
    one where the particles fill the lowest energy orbitals per spin.

    For a single spin, the model evaluates the lowest n energy orbitals, where n is the
    number of particles for that spin. In this model, each spin corresponds to a leaf in
    the input pytree x.

    If x is a single array (spinless input), then when this omega matches the omega in
    the potential, then model.apply(params, x) evaluates the first n eigenfunctions
    of the Hamiltonian on x. If there are multiple leaves in x, each of which is a
    different spin, then this behavior is mapped over each leaf.

    In other words, the .apply method has the signature

        (params, [x]) -> [orbital_matrix],

    where x has shape (..., n, 1) and orbital_matrix has shape (..., n, n), and the
    bracket notation is used to denote a pytree structure of spin. For example, if the
    inputs are (params, {"up": x_up, "down": x_down}), then the output will be
    {"up": orbitals_up, "down": orbitals_down}. The params consist of a single number, a
    model-specific omega.

    Because the particles are completely non-interacting in this model, there are no
    interactions computed between the leaves of the input pytree (or even between
    particles in a single leaf).

        omega_init (jnp.float32): initial value for omega in the model; when this
