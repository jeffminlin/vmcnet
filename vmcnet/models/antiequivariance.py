    """Compute a cofactor-based antiequivariance, returning results in slogabs form.

    Input must be square in the last two dimensions, of shape (..., n, n). The second
    last dimension is assumed to be the particle dimension, and the last is assumed
    to be the orbital dimension. The output will be of shape (..., n), preserving the
    particle dimension but getting rid of the orbital dimension.

    The transformation applies to each square matrix separately. Given an nxn matrix M,
    with cofactor matrix C, the output for that matrix will be a single vector of length
    n, whose ith component is M_(i,0)*C_(i,0)*(-1)**i. This is a single term in the
    cofactor expansion of the determinant of M. Thus, the sum of the returned vector
    values will always be equal to the determinant of M.

    This function implements an antiequivariant transformation, meaning that permuting
    two particle indices in the input will result in the output having 1) the same two
    particle indices permuted, and 2) ALL values multiplied by -1.

    Args:
        x (jnp.ndarray): a tensor of orbital matrices which is square in the last two
        dimensions, thus of shape (..., n, n). The second last dimension is the particle
        dimension, and the last is the orbital dimension.

    Returns:
        (jnp.ndarray, jnp.ndarray): tuple of arrays, each of shape (..., n). The first
        is sign(result), and the second is log(abs(result)).

            E.g., if nelec = 10, and `spin_split` = 2, then the input is split (5, 5).
            If nelec = 10, and `spin_split` = (2, 4), then the input is split into
            (2, 4, 4) -- note when `spin_split` is a sequence, there will be one more
            spin than the length of the sequence. In the original use-case of spin-1/2
            particles, `spin_split` should be either the number 2 (for closed-shell
            systems) or should be a Sequence with length 1 whose element is less than

        orbital_kernel_initializer_envelope_dim (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer
            for the decay rate in the exponential envelopes. If `isotropic_decay` is
            True, then this initializes a single decay rate number per ion and orbital.
            If`isotropic_decay` is False, then this initializes a 3x3 matrix per ion and

            linear part of the orbitals. Has signature
            (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        orbital_use_bias (bool, optional): whether to add a bias term to the linear part
            of the orbitals. Defaults to True.
        orbital_isotropic_decay (bool, optional): whether the decay for each ion should
            be anisotropic (w.r.t. the dimensions of the input), giving envelopes of the
