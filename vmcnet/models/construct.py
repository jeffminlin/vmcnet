        ndense_list: (list of (int, ...)): number of dense nodes in each of the
            residual blocks, (ndense_1e, optional ndense_2e). The length of this list

            this initializes a single decay rate number per ion and orbital. If
            `isotropic_decay` is False, then this initializes a 3x3 matrix per ion and
            orbital. Has signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray

            anisotropic (w.r.t. the dimensions of the input), giving envelopes of the
            form exp(-||A(r - R)||) for a dxd matrix A or isotropic, giving
            exp(-||a(r - R||)) for a number a.
        skip_connection (bool, optional): whether to add residual skip connections
            whenever the shapes of the input and outputs of the streams match. Defaults
            to True.
        cyclic_spins (bool, optional): whether the the concatenation in the one-electron
            stream should satisfy a cyclic equivariance structure, i.e. if there are
            three spins (1, 2, 3), then in the mixed part of the stream, after averaging
            but before the linear transformation, cyclic equivariance means the inputs
            are [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2)]. If False, then the inputs are
            [(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)] (as in the original FermiNet).
            When there are only two spins (spin-1/2 case), then this is equivalent to
            true spin equivariance. Defaults to False (original FermiNet).

    """Model with FermiNet backflow and a single antisymmetrized ResNet.

    The ResNet is antisymmetrized with respect to each spin split separately (i.e. the
    antisymmetrization operators for each spin are composed and applied).

    A simple isotropic exponential decay is added to ensure square-integrability (and
    because this is asymptotically correct for molecules).

    Attributes:
        spin_split (int or Sequence[int]): number of spins to split the input equally,
            or specified sequence of locations to split along the 2nd-to-last axis.
            E.g., if nelec = 10, and `spin_split` = 2, then the input is split (5, 5).
            If nelec = 10, and `spin_split` = (2, 4), then the input is split into
            (2, 4, 4) -- note when `spin_split` is a sequence, there will be one more
            spin than the length of the sequence. In the original use-case of spin-1/2
            particles, `spin_split` should be either the number 2 (for closed-shell
            systems) or should be a Sequence with length 1 whose element is less than
            the total number of electrons.
        ndense_list: (list of (int, ...)): number of dense nodes in each of the
            residual blocks, (ndense_1e, optional ndense_2e). The length of this list
            determines the number of residual blocks which are composed on top of the
            input streams. If ndense_2e is specified, then then a dense layer is applied
            to the two-electron stream with an optional skip connection, otherwise
            the two-electron stream is mixed into the one-electron stream but no
            transformation is done.
        ndense_resnet (int): number of dense nodes in each layer of the ResNet
        nlayers_resnet (int): number of layers in each antisymmetrized ResNet
        kernel_initializer_unmixed (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            unmixed part of the one-electron stream. This initializes the part of the
            dense kernel which multiplies the previous one-electron stream output. Has
            signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        kernel_initializer_mixed (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            mixed part of the one-electron stream. This initializes the part of the
            dense kernel which multiplies the average of the previous one-electron
            stream output. Has signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        kernel_initializer_2e_1e_stream (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            two-electron part of the one-electron stream. This initializes the part of
            the dense kernel which multiplies the average of the previous two-electron
            stream which is mixed into the one-electron stream. Has signature
            (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        kernel_initializer_2e_2e_stream (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            two-electron stream. Has signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        kernel_initializer_resnet (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for
            the dense layers in the antisymmetrized ResNet. Has signature
            (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        kernel_initializer_jastrow (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            decay rates in the exponential decay Jastrow factor. Has signature
            (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        bias_initializer_1e_stream (WeightInitializer): bias initializer for the
            one-electron stream. Has signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        bias_initializer_2e_stream (WeightInitializer): bias initializer for the
            two-electron stream. Has signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        bias_initializer_resnet (WeightInitializer): bias initializer for the
            dense layers in the antisymmetrized ResNet. Has signature
            (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        activation_fn_backflow (Activation): activation function in the electron
            streams. Has the signature jnp.ndarray -> jnp.ndarray (shape is preserved)
        activation_fn_resnet (Activation): activation function in the antisymmetrized
            ResNet. Has the signature jnp.ndarray -> jnp.ndarray (shape is preserved)
        ion_pos (jnp.ndarray, optional): locations of (stationary) ions to compute
            relative electron positions, 2-d array of shape (nion, d). Defaults to None.
        include_2e_stream (bool, optional): whether to compute pairwise electron
            displacements/distances. Defaults to True.
        include_ei_norm (bool, optional): whether to include electron-ion distances in
            the one-electron input. Defaults to True.
        include_ee_norm (bool, optional): whether to include electron-electron distances
            in the two-electron input. Defaults to True.
        streams_use_bias (bool, optional): whether to add a bias term in the electron
            streams. Defaults to True.
        resnet_use_bias (bool, optional): whether to add a bias term in the dense layers
            of the antisymmetrized ResNet. Defaults to True.
        skip_connection (bool, optional): whether to add residual skip connections
            whenever the shapes of the input and outputs of the streams match. Defaults
            to True.
        cyclic_spins (bool, optional): whether the the concatenation in the one-electron
            stream should satisfy a cyclic equivariance structure, i.e. if there are
            three spins (1, 2, 3), then in the mixed part of the stream, after averaging
            but before the linear transformation, cyclic equivariance means the inputs
            are [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2)]. If False, then the inputs are
            [(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)] (as in the original FermiNet backflow).
            When there are only two spins (spin-1/2 case), then this is equivalent to
            true spin equivariance. Defaults to False (original FermiNet backflow).
