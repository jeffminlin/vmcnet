        spin_split (int or Sequence[int]): number of spins to split the input equally,
            or specified sequence of locations to split along the 2nd-to-last axis.
            E.g., if nelec = 10, and `spin_split` = 2, then the input is split (5, 5).
            If nelec = 10, and `spin_split` = (2, 4), then the input is split into
            (2, 4, 4) -- note when `spin_split` is a sequence, there will be one more
            spin than the length of the sequence. In the original use-case of spin-1/2
            particles, `spin_split` should be either the number 2 (for closed-shell
            systems) or should be a Sequence with length 1 whose element is less than
            the total number of electrons.
        ndense_list: (list of (int, int)): number of dense nodes in each of the
            residual blocks, (ndense_1e, ndense_2e). The length of this list determines
            the number of residual blocks which are composed on top of the input streams
        kernel_initializer_unmixed (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            unmixed part of the one-electron stream. This initializes the part of the
            dense kernel which multiplies the previous one-electron stream output. Has
            signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        kernel_initializer_mixed (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            mixed part of the one-electron stream. This initializes the part of the
            dense kernel which multiplies the average of the previous one-electron
            stream output. Has signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        kernel_initializer_2e_1e_stream (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            two-electron part of the one-electron stream. This initializes the part of
            the dense kernel which multiplies the average of the previous two-electron
            stream which is mixed into the one-electron stream. Has signature
            (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        kernel_initializer_2e_2e_stream (WeightInitializer): kernel initializer for the
            two-electron stream. Has signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray

            two-electron stream. Has signature (key, shape, dtype) -> jnp.ndarray
        activation_fn (Activation): activation function in the electron streams. Has
            the signature jnp.ndarray -> jnp.ndarray (shape is preserved)
        use_bias (bool, optional): whether to add a bias term in the electron streams.
            Defaults to True.
        skip_connection (bool, optional): whether to add residual skip connections
            whenever the shapes of the input and outputs of the streams match. Defaults
            to True.
        cyclic_spins (bool, optional): whether the the concatenation in the one-electron
            stream should satisfy a cyclic equivariance structure, i.e. if there are
            three spins (1, 2, 3), then in the mixed part of the stream, after averaging
            but before the linear transformation, cyclic equivariance means the inputs
            are [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2)]. If False, then the inputs are
            [(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)] (as in the original FermiNet).
            When there are only two spins (spin-1/2 case), then this is equivalent to
            true spin equivariance. Defaults to False (original FermiNet).
