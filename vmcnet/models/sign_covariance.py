    Args:
        x (SLArray): input data to be symmetrized
        i (int): the index of this data in the SLArrayList. This is used to
            decide how often the sign should flip as the orbit is generated. For
            i = 0, the sign will flip every time; for i = 1, it will flip every other
            time; and so forth, flipping every 2**i times in general. This ensures that
            when this operation is applied separately to each element of an SLArrayList,
            the overall result is to generate the full orbit of the SLArrayList with
            respect to the sign of each SLArray entry.
        n_total (int): the total number of SLArrays involved. There will always be
            2**n_total symmetries generated, regardless of i.
        axis (int): the axis along which to insert the symmetries. For example, if axis
            is -2, n_total is 5, and the shape of x is (3,2,4), the output shape will be
            (3,2,32,4).

            SLogArray. This will look something like [x, x, -x, -x, x, x, ...]

    That is, output a function g(s_1, s_2, ..., s_n) with is odd with respect to each
    input, such that g(s_1, ...) = -g(-s_1, ...), and likewise for every other input.

    This is done by taking the orbit of the inputs with respect to the sign group
    applied separately to each one, and adding up the results with appropriate
    covariant signs. For example, for two spins this calculates
    g(U,D) = f(U,D) - f(-U,D) - f(U, -D) + f(-U, -D).

    As currently implemented, this method assumes the output of the function is a single
    SLArray, and that the function only applies to the last two axes of its inputs, so
    that the previous axes can all be treated as batch dimensions. Essentially, the
    function must be a map from inputs of shape (..., n[i], d) to outputs of shape
    (..., d'). This allows us to insert the orbit symmetries along axis -3 and then
    remove the extra dimension by summing over the inserted axis at the end, which
    considerably simplifies the implementation relative to handling a more general case.
